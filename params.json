Five seconds to prepare and the first set is started with horn sound. After the horn sound there is specified number of sets and between the each of them, there is rest time. The ending of rest time is signalized same as you hear at start. 4 beeps to prepare and horn sound to start. Every set is finished with triple bell sound.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
